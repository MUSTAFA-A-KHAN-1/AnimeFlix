# Custom Video Player Implementation

## Plan
1. Create `createCustomVideoPlayer()` function that builds the custom player HTML
2. Replace all instances of basic video element creation with custom player
3. Implement all control functionality:
   - Play/Pause toggle
   - Progress bar with click-to-seek, buffered bar
   - Volume control with slider
   - Skip buttons (10s forward/back)
   - Settings menu (playback speed, quality, etc.)
   - Fullscreen toggle
   - Episode navigation (prev/next)
   - Loading overlay
   - Error overlay with retry
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Space, M, F, Arrow keys, etc.)
   - Mouse movement auto-hide controls
4. Update both `displayHianimeScrapStream()` and `playStream()` to use custom player

## Files to Edit
- `src/main.js` - Add custom video player implementation

## Status: IN PROGRESS
